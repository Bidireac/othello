## General info
This was supposed to be a remake of the Othello game (which is the newer version of the Reversi ), using the base technologies such as Css, Html and Js.
But after a 2 months break from it, when I came back, I just didn't have the stamina to go through it again and complete it.So this is just the barebone version of the game logic.
